 * This class provides a shortestPath method for finding routes between two points

 * satisfaction (or the autograder), upgrade your implementation by switching it to A*.
 * Your code will probably not be fast enough to pass the autograder unless you use A*.
 * The difference between A* and Dijkstra's is only a couple of lines of code, and boils
 * down to the priority you use to order your vertices.
